# rsa-playground
My entry for a WWDC 2018 scholarship, an interactive playground all about RSA encryption.

Following my tradition of education focused playgrounds, this one provides an introduction to the mathematics behind RSA as well as providing an intuitive look at how it works. 

If you don't want to download it, here's a [video](https://youtu.be/d36YmVfUD9s).
